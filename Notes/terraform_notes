for azure need to pass subscription id and feature in provider


subscription id ===> u can export it on cli or set as environmental variable in local computer



**terraform validate ===> used to check configuration files syantax is correct and are consistent before deployment

**implicit dependancy ===> means resource in terraform uses attribute of other resource 

**explicit dependancy ===> means here adding meta argument 
depends_on []


** idempotenace

you will get same result (desired state) irrespective of number of times of execution --hence we called terraform execution is idempotent


**terraform console to validate expression we used in resource 

** count = is used to create almost identical objects in block

*** .tfvars = this variable file is used to provide variable values and command used to create infra 

terraform apply -var-file='<name>.tfvars'


***expression ===> using this we can take value from somewhere else , calculate or evalute it 
                   Result of expression is a value
                   All values have type  (string | number | bool | map | list | set)


***local ===> local value are assigned to expression so that we can use them multiple times instead of repeating expression 

***conditional expression ===> uses value of booolena expression to select one of two values
eg -condition ? true_val : false_val
